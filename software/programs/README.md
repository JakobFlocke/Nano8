# NANO8 Programs

This folder contains all programs designed to run on the NANO8 platform. These programs are organized into subfolders based on their runtime environment.

## Structure (planned)

- **`bare_metal/`**  
    Contains programs that run directly on the NANO8 hardware without an operating system. These are low-level applications designed for maximum performance and minimal overhead.

- **`os/`**  
    Contains programs that run on the NANO8 operating system. These applications leverage the OS's features and abstractions for easier development and enhanced functionality.
