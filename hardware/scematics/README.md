# NANO8 CPU Hardware Schematics and PCB Designs

This folder contains all the schematics and PCB designs for the NANO8 CPU project. All files in this directory are created and maintained using [KiCad](https://kicad.org/), an open-source electronics design automation (EDA) tool.

## Contents (planned)
- **Schematics**: Circuit diagrams for the NANO8 CPU and its components.
- **PCB Layouts**: Printed Circuit Board designs for manufacturing.
- **Supporting Files**: Any additional files required for the design process, such as libraries or templates.
